# ðŸ¤– MDP Group 17

This repository contains the codebase used for the team's CZ3004 Multidisciplinary Design Project (MDP) of Sem 1 AY19/20 in Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

## Project Objective

The objective of the Multidisciplinary Design Project (MDP) is to build an autonomous robot agent which can explore  an undefined maze and calculate the fastest path from the start to the goal position. It should also be able to calculate the fastest path through a predefined way point.

An Arduino will be used as the robot's controller while an Android device will be used to transmit and receive control signals. Algorithms will be run off a PC which will generate instructions for the robot. These 3 components will then communicate with each other through multiple networks set up by a Raspberry Pi.

## The Team

The team consists of 8 members which have been evenly divided into 4 sub-groups:

- Algorithm:
  - Kyle Huang Junyuan - [HJunyuan](https://github.com/HJunyuan)
  - Nelson Ko Mingwei - [NelsonKo93](https://github.com/NelsonKo93)
- Android:
  - Lee Wen Siong
  - Goh Chun Yi
- Arduino:
  - Tan Qin Kai - [multiplesyntaxerror](https://github.com/multiplesyntaxerror)
  - Arkar Min (Project Manager) - [Akmystery](https://github.com/Akmystery)
- Raspberry Pi:
  - Chua Wen Kai
  - Chen Xingyu

## Code Structure

The source code for each sub-group can be found in its respective folders.
